# Genera Code of Conduct

## Rules
* All pull requests are subject to code review by a Genera developer, whether you like it or not.
* Don't do anything to harm the community.
  * This includes illegal activities. Don't do those.

## Discord Rules
* No direct messaging a team member without their permission.
* No profane language or overtly offensive speech.
* The Discord is an oligarchy; what the developers say goes.  

## Punishment
* All violations are punishable by two warnings and then a banishment from writing messages and contributing, with possibility of appeal.
  * This is liable to change based on the acting developer's own discretion.
* Ban appeals should be put in the Discord; hopefully we don't get too many.
